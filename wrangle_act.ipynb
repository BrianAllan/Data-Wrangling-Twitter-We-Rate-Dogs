Combine the 'doggo', 'floofer', 'pupper', and 'puppo' columns into a single variable, `dog_designation`, in which these designations become values of the variable.  Rare exceptions with dual designations can be handled by allowing the hyphenated values 'floofer-doggo', 'puppo-doggo' and 'pupper-doggo' to stand in for the corresponding combination.\n",

    "**Explanation**: The new column `dog_designation` will register the designation attributed to a dog by We Rate Dogs, when such a designation was given.  When no designation was given, it shall take a null value.  So, `dog_designation` does not signify what a dog really is, rather what We Rate Dogs designated, if any designation was given.  Second, although 'puppo', 'pupper', and 'doggo' are often used to desginate mutually exclusive stages in the development of a dog (one might call this the developmental use of these terms) so that a 'puppo' is a really young dog, a 'pupper' an adolescent, and a 'doggo' an adult, the terms are not always used this way.  The term 'doggo' sometimes has a generic usage, covering any dog no matter what age.  With the generic usage of 'doggo' in play, something can be both a pupper and a doggo -- a \"pupper-doggo\".  Similarly, a dog can be a 'puppo-doggo' or a 'fluffer-doggo' when 'doggo' is used in the generic sense.  Sometimes, however, dual designations are due to the fact that the tweet concerns a picture with two dogs in it."

    "**Observation**: Where the denominator is not 10, it is because there is more than one dog involved.  In the above list, 1165 and 1202 should not be included because there were two ratios in the text and the extraction picked up the first ratio when the second was really the one wanted.  Excluding those two cases, in all the rest of the cases a denominator greater than 10 indicates the presence of more than one dog.  A denominator greater than 10 is a sufficient indicator of more than one dog, but not a necessary one.  This is evidenced by case 1165 which includes more than one dog and awards \"13/10 for all\"."

    "\"We Rate Dogs\" provides ratings as a ratio with a non-negative numerator and a denominator that is often 10 or some multiple of 10 -- for example \"13/10\".  When the denominator is some multiple of 10, it is almost always because more than one dog is involved in the picture(s).  For what follows, we will exclude cases with multiple dogs as best we can by only looking at ratings where the denominator is 10.  (This technique is not a perfect filter for just posts about a single dog since sometimes a rating might be give as \"12/10 for each one\".  But at least in that case the rating is clearly meant to apply to each individual rather than to the group in aggregate.)  By selecting posts only where the denominator is 10, we can summarize the rating easily by simply looking at the rating numerator alone, which we will do."

    "It was observed informally that low ratings sometimes indicate that a picture does not contain a dog but rather a different kind of animal (like a hedge hog, for example).  We will investigate using ratings as an indicator for whether the post concerns a dog.  The question we would like to investigate here is, \"Does 'We Rate Dogs' use low ratings to indicate that the post is not about a dog?\"  Or more precisely, \"How strong of an indicator is the rating for the presence of a dog in the post?\"  To do this, we would need to know which posts concern a dog and which do not.  Apart from recording that information for each post by means of human observation (a tedious task), we will use the machine learning (ML) predictions data provided to us as a benchmark for whether a post concerns a dog.  This is an imperfect benchmark, since the prediction data itself should be tested for reliability.  So, the more accurate way of looking at this investigation is as a comparison of using the ratings as dog predictors with the machine learning prediction data provided.  The ML prediction data provides three ranked predictions -- first, second, and third in confidence.  We will compare the ratings as dog predictors with (1) the top ranked predictions of the ML algorithm as well as with (2) the conjunction of the ranked predictions.  The latter case is a conservative prediction and will only predict a dog when all three ranked predictions say there is a dog (i.e., the conjunction of the predictions); otherwise, the default will be that there is not a dog."
